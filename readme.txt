Our plugin allows customers to import products from the MonstaManagement system into their very own Wordpress based websites, using a unique API key for each store.

The plugin is able to import a variety of data including products, suppliers (brands), product groupings, categories and sub-categories from the MonstaManagement system.

Store owners are able to view their orders inside their linked MonstaManagement accounts.

Installation Instructions

Visit your Wordpress backend, then navigate to Plugins -> Add New and upload monstamanagement.zip
Make sure to activate the plugin after installation
After installation and activation, be sure to visit Settings -> MonstaManagement and paste your API key into the appropriate box. Should you not have your API key, be sure to click the ‘Get API Key’ button to redirect to your store’s settings.
Once your API Key is inserted, be sure to click ‘Save Settings’.
To commence your import, ensure some products are set to sync to your Wordpress site. You can control this from the MonstaManagement system by visiting ‘Browse Web Products’.
Next, click the ‘Import Product’ button within Wordpress, or the ‘Synchronize Now’ button within MonstaManagement to commence the import of your selected products.
Note that all product groupings will automatically be pulled into a menu labelled ‘Monsta Menu’ in case you wish to display this on your website frontend. This can be found via Wordpress Backend -> Appearance -> Menus.
